# Multi-class-classification

In used dataset we had 11 classes, each corresponding to a digit from 0 to 10, so we have to classify each class.
I have done that by 2 different ways, first by using Logistic regression(one vs all method)
and second by using a neural network using softmax classification layer.





Picked the Dataset from this [Programming exercise](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/programming/Y54Zu/multi-class-classification-and-neural-networks)
